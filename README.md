# 004_Improved_Sliding_Puzzle_Godot
A simple sliding puzzle game made with Godot Engine 4.

An image of 1024 by 1024 pixels is split into the 16 tiles. The tiles are randomly shuffled at the start of the game and you should order the tiles to complete the image.

You can watch the video on how I made it here:
